# Django Backend Project

This project is a Django-based backend application. Follow the instructions below to set it up and run it locally.

---

## Quick Start

For those who prefer a one-liner, open your terminal and run the following:

### macOS/Linux:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git && cd your-repo && python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py migrate && python manage.py runserver
```

### Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git; cd your-repo; python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; pip install -r requirements.txt; python manage.py migrate; python manage.py runserver
```

*Replace `your-username/your-repo` with your actual repository URL.*

## Detailed Setup and Run Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites
- **Python 3.x:** Ensure Python is installed (check with `python --version`).
- **Git:** Make sure Git is installed to clone the repository.
- (Optional) **Virtual Environment:** Highly recommended to isolate project dependencies.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
```
*This downloads the project files to your computer.*

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```
Activate the virtual environment:
- **On macOS/Linux:**
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **On Windows:**
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
*Using a virtual environment ensures that your project's dependencies remain isolated from system-wide packages.*

### 4. Install Dependencies
Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*This command installs all Python packages specified in `requirements.txt`.*

### 5. Apply Database Migrations
Set up your database schema by applying migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
*Migrations create the necessary tables and schema for your Django project.*

### 6. Run the Development Server
Start the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
Open your browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to view the application.

## Optional: Debugging in VS Code

If you use Visual Studio Code and wish to debug your Django project:
1. Open the **Run and Debug** panel (press `Ctrl + Shift + D`).
2. Click **"Create a launch.json file"** and select the Django template.
3. Start the debugger to set breakpoints and inspect your code.

*This helps in diagnosing issues by letting you step through your code.*
